- React is a JavaScript library.

- Usually called a "framework".

- Used to build front-end apps.

- Allows user-interaction at a new level.

------------

- Components can have a "state", which is an obkect that determines how
  that component renders and behaves.

- We can also have "application level" state by using a "state manager"
  like Redux or Reacts own conext API.

  State object:

  state = {
    title: 'xxx',
    body: 'xxx',
    isFeatured: true
  }

- Download Node.js, we will need "npm" (Node package manager) to install 
  dependencies.

- Use "create react app" to generate a sample project.  
  npx create-react-app // Use this command in current folder while in terminal.

- Use "npm start" in the directory of your app to start the server.
- The page has auto reload on save.
